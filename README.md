# zworld-afterlife
Repository for all development towards the Gmod gamemode "zworld-afterlife", by the New Town Morrison community. Including config files, .db files, maps, etc.

Disclaimer: This repository will NOT contain any contents from the offical gamemode developed by Nordahl. Such action would be considered "leaking", something I strictly condone. You can find the original gamemode, made for purchase, from his website in the following link...

Feel free to contact me for any inquires or questions, the administration panel can definitely be challenging for first-time buyers :)
